In my Web Fundamentals class at Camosun College, I created a responsive, one-page website using HTML5 and CSS3. The requirements included making the page responsive for 3 screen sizes (desktop, iPad, iPhone 6/7/8 plus) without the use of frameworks.

The page was to consist of a navigation menu fixed to the top of the page, and four content sections.

The first section had to include a video playing in the background taking up the entire viewing area, and a header styled with a unique font.

The second section had to contain three images, three headers, and three short paragraphs. These three images had to appear horizontal on a desktop screen, but appear vertically stacked for an iPad or iPhone.

The third section had to be an ‘about’ or information page with a background image, header and paragraph with clear and readable text. The fourth section had to be a sign up section with a form containing two inputs and a button.

Video from the first video section had to be playing in the background of the fourth section, and inside the form the same video (blurred) was to be playing in the background. 

The topic I chose to make the one-page website on was a Photography Portfolio/Adventure blog for myself. I was able to use all my own original content for the images and video.

The key learnings for this assignment were CSS positioning and media queries. Two of the biggest challenges I came across when building this page were figuring out how to get the video from the first section to show up as the background in the fourth section, and getting the blurred video to fit inside the form container.

I enjoyed experimenting with different colour pallets, and trying to bring some creativity into a simplistic design.
